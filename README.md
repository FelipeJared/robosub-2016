# robosub-2016
GUI and Navigation Management System used to control the [Mechatronics Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)](https://robonation.org/app/uploads/sites/4/2019/10/SDSU_RS17_Paper.pdf) for the [International RoboSub Competition](https://robonation.org/programs/robosub/). The AUV had to complete an [obstacle course](https://robonation.org/app/uploads/sites/4/2020/01/RoboSub_2017_Final_Mission_v2_5.pdf) where it had to pass though the start gate, recognize and bump the correct buoys, drop a marker on the correct bin, shoot a torpedo through the correct target, and navigate to a pinger.

Running main/launch_gui.py will start the GUI Process as well as the Navigation Management Process.
